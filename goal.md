# unexpected results

- program didnt handle replies on a twitter account which resulted in errors in the terminal
- official result and official scorecard were mixed up which
  resulted in a messy output
- forgot to mention one edge case to handle the regular expression for scorecard and official result

# goals for today

- set up docker compose to spin up dockerfile and database
- set up database tables as well as migrations
- add inserts and queries for the database
- set up VPS server and deploy?
- release 1.0.0
